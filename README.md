##### Funding & Growth Analysis with Machine Learning Insights

##### This project analyzes startup funding trends worldwide using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, interactive dashboards, and predictive modeling. Built with Python and Power BI, it provides insights into the global startup landscape and predicts Series A funding success.

#### 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and processed complex startup funding datasets (missing values, inconsistent country names, etc.)

- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard featuring:

    - Global funding trends over time

    - Top markets and industries by total funding

    - Geographic startup distribution (map visualizations)

    - Debt financing breakdown by industry

    - Filters by country, year, and market

- Conducted in-depth EDA to uncover patterns across regions, industries, and funding rounds


#### 📌 Machine Learning Component

- Trained and evaluated models to predict whether a startup would raise Series A funding based on seed-stage features.

- Models Used:
  Logistic Regression – Accuracy: 95.8%
  Random Forest Classifier – Accuracy: 96.5%

- Evaluation: High precision, recall, and F1-scores (0.96+)

   Strong confusion matrix performance on both classes

    Random Forest slightly outperformed Logistic Regression

#### 📌 Tech Stack
- Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly

- Power BI: Dashboard development, data modeling, visualization

- ML Concepts: Supervised learning, classification, evaluation metrics

#### 📌 Future Enhancements
- Time-series forecasting: Predict funding trends by country

- Clustering: Group startups by funding, stage, and location
  

- Investor analysis: Identify top VC players by portfolio performance
